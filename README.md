Goal

To enhance proficiency in Power Query by applying techniques such as column transformations, splitting and merging values, removing duplicates, filtering inconsistencies, and converting messy text into structured formats.

Key Techniques Applied

•	Split & Normalize: Converted wide-format merged values into individual rows using delimiter-based splits.

•	Character Replacement: Cleaned inconsistent text entries by mapping characters (e.g., "i" → "1", "o" → "0") across multiple columns.

•	Duplicate Removal: Used both single-column and multi-column logic to eliminate redundant entries and maintain data integrity.

•	Row Unpivoting: Transformed wide tables into long format for better trend analysis and category segmentation.

•	Conditional Formatting: Applied logic to standardize labels (used consistent rules or methods to make sure the labels (names, categories, tags, etc.) in the dataset are uniform
, flag outliers (identified data points that are unusually high or low compared to the rest), and fix structural inconsistencies (made sure the data is organized the same way across the board).

Outcome

This exercise boosted my confidence in handling different types of messy data using Power Query. I learned practical skills that help me organize information better, which is super useful for future analysis and decision-making.
